    "# Gemini can respond to prompts about audio. For example, Gemini can:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Describe, summarize, or answer questions about audio content.\n",
    "-Provide a transcription of the audio.\n",
    "-Provide answers or a transcription about a specific segment of the audio.\n",
    "Note: You can't generate audio output with the Gemini API.\n",
    "This guide demonstrates different ways to interact with audio files and audio content using the Gemini API.\n",

    "# Supported audio formats\n",
    "Gemini supports the following audio format MIME types:\n",
    "\n",
    "WAV - audio/wav\n",

    "Technical details about audio\n",
    "Gemini imposes the following rules on audio:\n",

    "Gemini can only infer responses to English-language speech.\n",
    "Gemini can \"understand\" non-speech components, such as birdsong or sirens.\n",
    "The maximum supported length of audio data in a single prompt is 9.5 hours. Gemini doesn't limit the number of audio files in a single prompt; however, the total combined length of all audio files in a single prompt cannot exceed 9.5 hours.\n",
    "Gemini downsamples audio files to a 16 Kbps data resolution.\n",
    "If the audio source contains multiple channels, Gemini combines those channels down to a single channel.\n",
