    "\n",
    "-Describe, summarize, or answer questions about audio content.\n",
    "-Provide a transcription of the audio.\n",
    "-Provide answers or a transcription about a specific segment of the audio.\n",

    "# Supported audio formats\n",
    "Gemini supports the following audio format MIME types:\n",
    "\n",
    "WAV - audio/wav\n",
    "MP3 - audio/mp3\n",
    "AIFF - audio/aiff\n",
    "AAC - audio/aac\n",
    "OGG Vorbis - audio/ogg\n",
    "FLAC - audio/flac\n",
    "Technical details about audio\n",
    "Gemini imposes the following rules on audio:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini represents each second of audio as 25 tokens; for example, one minute of audio is represented as 1,500 tokens.\n",
    "Gemini can only infer responses to English-language speech.\n",
    "Gemini can \"understand\" non-speech components, such as birdsong or sirens.\n",
    "The maximum supported length of audio data in a single prompt is 9.5 hours. Gemini doesn't limit the number of audio files in a single prompt; however, the total combined length of all audio files in a single prompt cannot exceed 9.5 hours.\n",
    "Gemini downsamples audio files to a 16 Kbps data resolution.\n",
    "If the audio source contains multiple channels, Gemini combines those channels down to a single channel.\n",
    "Before you begin: Set up your project and API key\n",
    "Before calling the Gemini API, you need to set up your project and configure your API key."

      "result.text='This audio clip is a motivational speech, likely aimed at men, focusing on the importance of discipline and overcoming challenges to achieve freedom and success.  Here\\'s a breakdown of the key themes:\\n\\n* **Embrace Failure, Achieve Victory:** The speaker emphasizes that failure is an inevitable part of life, and that repeated failures ultimately lead to success.  This is presented as a necessary path to growth and achievement.\\n\\n* **Action over Inaction:** The speaker strongly advocates for taking action and confronting challenges head-on, even if it\\'s difficult. Inaction is presented as a path to stagnation and a life of mere existence rather than living fully.\\n\\n* **Discipline and Freedom:**  The core message revolves around the idea that discipline leads to freedom.  This applies to various aspects of life, such as health, finances, and time management.  A lack of discipline results in being a \"slave\" to unhealthy habits, financial difficulties, or lack of free time.\\n\\n* **Extreme Ownership:** The speaker promotes taking ownership of one\\'s failures and successes, attributing the results to oneself rather than blaming external factors. This self-accountability is seen as crucial for growth.\\n\\n* **Emotional Regulation:** While acknowledging the importance of experiencing emotions, the speaker stresses the need to manage and control them.  Allowing emotions to dictate one\\'s actions is viewed negatively.  The ideal is balance; not suppressing feelings, but not letting them control one\\'s life.\\n\\n* **The Importance of Balance:** The speech concludes by advocating for balance in all areas of life, including emotional regulation, and avoiding extremes.\\n\\n* **Taking Action in Uncertainty:** Even if one feels lost and unsure, the speaker urges taking a step forward, as remaining stagnant only leads to further negative outcomes.\\n\\nThe speech is delivered with a powerful and determined tone, emphasizing the speaker\\'s belief in the importance of effort, resilience, and self-control in achieving success.  The use of strong, repetitive phrases like \"you\\'re going to fail\" serves to drive home the message of perseverence.\\n'\n"
